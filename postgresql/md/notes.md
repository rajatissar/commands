# Notes

```text
- SQL language is case insensitive. It means that SELECT or select has the same effect.
- The semicolon is not a part of the SQL statement. It is used to signal PostgreSQL the end of an SQL statement. The semicolon is also used to separate two SQL statements.
- ORDER BY uses ASC by default.
- SQL standard only allows you to sort rows based on the columns that appear in the SELECT clause. However, PostgreSQL allows you to sort rows based on the columns that even does not appear in the selection list
- The order of rows returned from the SELECT statement is unpredictable therefore the “first” row of each group of the duplicate is also unpredictable. It is good practice to always use the ORDER BY clause with the DISTINCT ON(expression) to make the result set obvious.
- LIMIT- The statement returns n rows generated by the query. If n is zero, the query returns an empty set. In case n is NULL, the query returns the same result set as omitting the LIMIT clause.
- Because the order of the rows in the database table is unspecified, when you use the LIMIT clause, you should always use the ORDER BY clause to control the row order. If you don’t do so, you will get a result set whose rows are in an unspecified order.
- LIMIT clause is not a SQL-standard. To conform with the SQL standard, PostgreSQL provides the FETCH clause to retrieve a portion of rows returned by a query. Note that the FETCH clause was introduced in SQL:2008.
- PostgreSQL executes the query with the IN operator much faster than the same query that uses a list of OR operators.
- BETWEEN - If you want to check a value against of date ranges, you should use the literal date in ISO 8601 format i.e., YYYY-MM-DD.
- LIKE - If the pattern does not contain any wildcard character, the LIKE operator acts like the equal ( =) operator.
- NULL - The comparison of NULL with a value will always result in NULL, which means an unknown result.
- Because PostgreSQL evaluates the ORDER BY clause after the SELECT clause, you can use the column alias in the ORDER BY clause. Other clauses evaluated before the SELECT clause such as WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING, you cannot reference the column alias in these clauses.
- When you join a table to itself a.k.a self-join, you must use table aliases.
- JOIN - A natural join can be an inner join, left join, or right join. If you do not specify a join explicitly e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, PostgreSQL will use the INNER JOIN by default.
- GROUP BY - The GROUP BY clause must appear right after the FROM or WHERE clause.
- GROUP BY - The GROUP BY clause is useful when it is used in conjunction with an aggregate function
- GROUP BY - To filter groups, you use the HAVING clause instead of WHERE clause.
- HAVING - The HAVING clause sets the condition for group rows created by the GROUP BY clause after the GROUP BY clause applies while the WHERE clause sets the condition for individual rows before GROUP BY clause applies. This is the main difference between the HAVING and WHERE clauses.
- HAVING - In PostgreSQL, you can use the HAVING clause without the GROUP BY clause. In this case, the HAVING clause will turn the query into a single group.
- PostgreSQL provides the GROUPING SETS, CUBE which is the subclause of the GROUP BY clause.
- ANY / SOME - SOME is a synonym for ANY, meaning that you can substitute SOME for ANY in any SQL statement.
- ANY - The = ANY is equivalent to IN operator.
- ANY - The <> ANY operator is different from NOT IN. The following expression:
x <> ANY (a,b,c)
is equivalent to
x <> a OR <> b OR x <> c
- The date format is YYYY-MM-DD
